# Netlify Deployment Instructions

## 🚀 How to Deploy to Netlify

### Method 1: Deploy via Netlify UI (Recommended)

1. **Build your project locally first:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and sign up/login**

3. **Drag and Drop Method:**
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard
   - Drag your `build` folder directly to the Netlify deploy area
   - Your site will be deployed instantly!

### Method 2: Deploy via Git (GitHub/GitLab)

1. **Push your code to GitHub/GitLab**

2. **Connect to Netlify:**
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose your repository
   - Set build settings:
     - Build command: `npm run build`
     - Publish directory: `build`
   - Click "Deploy site"

### Method 3: Netlify CLI

1. **Install Netlify CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Login to Netlify:**
   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   netlify deploy
   ```

4. **For production:**

   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The `netlify.toml` file is already configured with:
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `build`
- Node.js version: 18
- SPA redirects for React Router

## 🔧 Environment Variables (if needed)

If you need environment variables, add them in Netlify Dashboard:
- Go to Site Settings > Environment Variables
- Add any required variables

## 📝 Notes

- Your React app uses React Router, so the redirect rule in `netlify.toml` handles client-side routing
- The build process will create optimized production files
- Netlify automatically provides HTTPS and CDN

## 🎉 After Deployment

Your site will be available at: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`

You can also set up a custom domain in Netlify Dashboard.
